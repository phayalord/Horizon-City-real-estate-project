# horizon-City-real-estate-project
Welcome to my Interior Design Web App project! This project showcases my web development and design skills by providing an online platform to help users design and visualize their interior spaces using React.js.


The app features a user-friendly interface that allows users to:

Upload floor plans and room dimensions
Drag and drop furniture and decor items onto the floor plan
Experiment with different layouts and configurations
Visualize the final design in 3D
Save and share their designs with others


The app is built using the following technologies:

React.js framework for building UI components
Three.js library for 3D visualization
Firebase for authentication and database management
The project includes detailed documentation and a guide for setting up the app locally.


I created this project to provide an innovative solution for interior design enthusiasts and professionals alike. Please note that this project is still a work in progress and I am continuously adding new features and improvements to the app.


In the future, the app will also include:

More customizable options for furniture and decor items
A shopping cart feature to purchase items directly from the app
A feature to schedule appointments with professional interior designers
Please feel free to explore the code, contribute to the project, and share your feedback and suggestions. Thank you for checking out my Interior Design Web App project!
